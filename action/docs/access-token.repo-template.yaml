# Grant repository scoped permissions
# NOTE: Every statement will always implicitly grant `metadata: read` permission.
statements:
  - subjects:
      # === Subject Pattern examples ===
      #
      # grant access to jobs running on the main branch
      # - repo:${origin}:ref:refs/heads/main
      # grant access jobs running on any tag starting with a v
      # - repo:${origin}:ref:refs/tags/v*
      # grant access to jobs using production environment
      # - repo:${origin}:environment:production
      # grant access to jobs of a specific workflow file
      # - repo:${origin}:workflow_ref:${origin}/.github/workflows/build.yml@refs/heads/main

      # === Subject Pattern Variables and Wildcards ===
      #
      # ${origin} - resolves to the origin repository name e.g. qoomon/sandbox
      # '*' - match every character except ':'
      # ':**' - match every following claim, can only be used at the end of a subject pattern

      # === GitHub Actions OIDC Token Subjects ===
      #
      # A GitHub Actions job will always have the following subjects
      # The original OIDC token 'sub' claim e.g. repo:${origin}:ref:refs/heads/main or repo:${origin}:environment:production
      # repo:${origin}:ref:<ref> e.g. repo:${origin}:ref:refs/heads/main
      # repo:${origin}:environment:<environment> e.g. repo:${origin}:environment:production
      # repo:${origin}:workflow_ref:<workflow_ref> e.g. repo:${origin}:workflow_ref:${origin}/.github/workflows/build.yml@refs/heads/main
      # repo:${origin}:job_workflow_ref:<job_workflow_ref> e.g. repo:${origin}:job_workflow_ref:${origin}/.github/workflows/build.yml@refs/heads/main
